# AI Reproducibility Experiment - Context for Implementation

## Experiment Overview

You are participating in a controlled experiment to test **AI reproducibility in software development**. Your task is to implement a complete application from formal specifications, and your output will be compared against:
1. An original implementation created through conversational AI development
2. Implementations created by other AI models using the same specifications

## Your Task

Implement the **AI News & Learning Resource Aggregator** exactly as described in the specifications provided below. This is a full-stack web application with:
- Node.js backend with Express API
- SQLite database
- Vanilla JavaScript frontend
- Docker deployment
- RSS feed aggregation from 20+ sources
- Gamification features (voting, progress tracking, celebrations)

## What We're Testing

### Primary Hypothesis
Can comprehensive specifications enable different AI models to create functionally equivalent implementations of the same software system?

### Research Questions
1. **Completeness**: Are the specifications sufficient, or do you need clarifications?
2. **Consistency**: Will your implementation match the architecture and structure described?
3. **Interpretation**: Where do you make decisions not explicitly specified?
4. **Quality**: How does code quality compare across different implementations?
5. **Efficiency**: How long does implementation take compared to conversational development?
6. **Creativity**: Do you add improvements beyond the specifications?

## Specifications

You will receive 4 specification documents:

### 1. Constitution (Project Principles)
- Core values: Simplicity, data integrity, UX, deployment, code quality
- Architecture patterns and constraints
- Technology requirements and prohibitions
- Quality metrics and success criteria

### 2. Specification (What to Build)
- User stories for 3 personas
- Functional requirements for all features
- API contracts (8 REST endpoints)
- Database schema (11 columns, 3 indexes)
- Behavioral specifications
- Non-functional requirements

### 3. Plan (How to Build)
- Technology stack with rationale
- Database design details
- API implementation guidance
- File structure and organization
- Docker deployment strategy
- Development workflow

### 4. Tasks (Implementation Steps)
- 10 development phases
- 60+ individual tasks with acceptance criteria
- Dependencies between tasks
- Test cases for validation
- Estimated completion time: ~23 hours

## Implementation Guidelines

### What to Track (For Later Analysis)

**Time Metrics**:
- Total implementation time
- Time per phase (setup, database, API, frontend, Docker, etc.)
- Time spent on clarifications vs. implementation

**Clarification Tracking**:
- What questions do you have about the specifications?
- What ambiguities require interpretation?
- What decisions do you make that aren't explicitly specified?

**Deviation Tracking**:
- Where does your implementation differ from specifications?
- Why did you make different choices?
- What improvements or optimizations did you add?

**Issues Encountered**:
- Technical challenges
- Specification gaps or contradictions
- Dependencies or tooling problems

### Expected Outputs

**File Structure** (should match):
```
ai-agent/
├── package.json (8 dependencies)
├── Dockerfile
├── docker-compose.yml
├── README.md
├── data/
│   └── resources.db (SQLite)
├── public/
│   └── index.html (SPA with embedded CSS/JS)
└── src/
    ├── index.js (CLI)
    ├── server.js (Express, 8 API endpoints)
    ├── db.js (Database operations)
    ├── config.js (20+ RSS feeds)
    ├── organizer.js (Categorization logic)
    └── sources/
        ├── rssSource.js
        └── webScraper.js
```

**Expected File Count**: 28 files total

**Key Features to Implement**:
- ✅ 8 REST API endpoints (fetch, items, toggle, vote, stats, sources/top, journey)
- ✅ Database with 11 columns, 3 indexes
- ✅ UI with 5 tabs (All, News, Courses, Reading, Journey)
- ✅ Checkbox persistence across sessions
- ✅ Upvote/downvote system
- ✅ Progress tracking with milestones (5, 10, 20, 50, 100)
- ✅ Celebration modals with GIFs
- ✅ Top sources ranking by net votes
- ✅ Docker containerization

### Success Criteria

Your implementation is successful if:
1. All 28 files are created with correct structure
2. All 8 API endpoints are functional
3. Database schema matches specifications exactly
4. UI has all 5 tabs and gamification features
5. Fetch completes in < 60 seconds
6. API responses < 200ms
7. Docker deployment works (build, run, persist data)
8. No crashes during normal operation

## Multi-Model Experiment

This experiment will be run with **2-3 different AI models** (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, etc.). Each model will:
1. Receive identical specifications
2. Implement independently
3. Create artifacts in separate directories

## Implementation Instructions

### Step 1: Review Specifications
Read all 4 specification documents carefully before starting implementation.

### Step 2: Ask Clarifying Questions
If anything is unclear or ambiguous, ask questions before implementing. Document all questions and your decisions.

### Step 3: Implement Following Task Order
Follow the task breakdown in the specifications:
1. Project setup (npm, directories)
2. Database layer (schema, CRUD operations)
3. Configuration (RSS feeds, manual resources)
4. Data fetching (RSS parser, categorization)
5. API server (Express, 8 endpoints)
6. CLI (fetch and stats commands)
7. Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS, 5 tabs, gamification)
8. Docker (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml)
9. Documentation (README, QUICKSTART, SETUP)
10. Testing and polish

### Step 4: Test Each Component
As you implement, test each component to ensure it works before moving to the next phase.

### Step 5: Create Final Artifacts
After implementation, create:
- `IMPLEMENTATION-LOG.md` documenting your process
- `METRICS.json` with quantitative metrics
- Zip or commit your implementation to designated directory

### Step 6: Functional Testing
Verify:
- `npm install` works
- `docker-compose up` works
- UI loads at http://localhost:3000
- Fetch button aggregates items
- Checkbox toggling persists
- Voting system works
- Journey tab shows progress
- Celebration modal appears at milestones

## Constraints & Rules

### Do Follow:
✅ Implement exactly as specified in the 4 documents
✅ Use the specified tech stack (Node.js 20, SQLite, Express, vanilla JS)
✅ Match the file structure and organization
✅ Implement all 8 API endpoints
✅ Create all 28 files
✅ Document questions and decisions

### Do NOT:
❌ Use prohibited technologies (TypeScript, React, external databases)
❌ Add features not in the specifications (unless noted as improvements)
❌ Skip required features or phases
❌ Use external references or prior knowledge of this project
❌ Copy code from other implementations

## Important Notes

### On Specifications Completeness
The specifications are comprehensive but may not cover every implementation detail. When you encounter ambiguity:
1. Document the ambiguity
2. Make a reasonable decision based on the specifications' principles
3. Explain your reasoning
4. Continue implementation

### On Code Quality
Follow the quality standards in the constitution:
- Files under 300 lines
- Functions under 50 lines
- Clear naming (no abbreviations)
- Error handling in all async operations
- Comments explain "why", not "what"

### On Testing
The specifications indicate manual testing only (no automated test frameworks). Test functionality as you build.

### On Time
Don't rush. The original took 3 hours of conversational development. Take whatever time you need to implement correctly.

## Context End

You now have all the context needed. Please confirm you understand the task, then request the 4 specification documents to begin implementation.
