   Better: "API responses: <200ms for stats, <100ms for items (50 records)"
   ```

2. **Clarify Documentation Requirements**
   ```markdown
   Required: README.md with quickstart
   Recommended: SETUP.md for detailed installation
   Optional: CHANGELOG.md, RESOURCES.md
   ```

3. **Define CORS Requirements**
   ```markdown
   - Enable CORS for API endpoints
   - Configurable origins via environment variable
   ```

4. **Request Time Tracking**
   ```markdown
   - Track implementation time by phase
   - Document in METRICS.json
   - Include question count
   ```

5. **Specify Concurrency Handling**
   ```markdown
   - Limit concurrent external requests to prevent rate limiting
